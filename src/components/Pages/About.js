               <h1>About Us</h1>
               <hr/>

               <h2>
                   A HeRoP Project  
                </h2>
                <p>

               This project is brought to you by the <a href=""> Health Regions & Policies Lab (HeRoP)</a> at the Center for Spatial Data Science at the University
                    of Chicago. HeRoP integrates innovative GIScience, public health, and statistical approaches to explore, understand, and promote healthy regions and policies.
                    Our group is dedicated to Open Science and open source methodology & applications. We are committed to research translation for policy & public use. 
                    Each project has both a research and applied component, like the <a href="">US Covid Atlas</a> and the <a href="">Opioid Environment Policy Scan</a>. <br/><br/>

                    Weâ€™re interested in how place drives, interacts with, and influences health for different people, in different ways. 
                    To explore this further, we look at neighborhoods as complex systems with spatial signals that help decode their stories.

               <h2>
                   Background: the Community Tree Tool Research Pilot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before <i>ChiVes</i>, HeRoP worked in joint partnership with the Chicago Department of Public Health to develop the <b> <a href="">Community Tree Equity Tool </a></b>
                     as a part of the Bloomberg Partnership for Health Cities project managed by Vital Strategies. The Tree Tool Research Pilot was developed using 
                     <a href=""> Carto</a> to facilitate rapid development and prototyping. This tool followed years of iterative process and design and dozens
                     of previous dashboard iterations, highlighting the winding process of agile application development. The final tool went through dozens of additional
                     rounds of refinement and editing across multiple city and community stakeholders.
                     <br/><br/> 

                    In the Research Pilot Stage, The <a href="">HeRoP</a> team was led by Marynia Kolak, MS, MFA, PhD (Associate Director of Health Informatics) and supported by 
                    research assistants Isaac Kamber, Lorenz Menendez, Yuming Liu, and Jizhou Wang, with previous analytic work by graduate 
                    student Haowen Shang, and ongoing collaboration with Center for Spatial Data Science Academic Director, Luc Anselin, PhD, Executive Director,    
                    Julia Koschinsky, PhD, as well as Raed Mansour, MS and Dave Graham at the Chicago Department of Public Health. Dozens of additional, invaluable contributors 
                    public, private, and community stakeholders impacted the success of the Tree Tool application: follow the City of Chicago for more details coming soon!

<h2>
                   ChiVes: An OpenSource, Interactive Platform for Coalition Building
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the completion of the research pilot, HeRoP refactored the data into a fresh, newly customized web mapping application. This
                    facilitates more open, flexible, and free design and allows the community to collaborate more directly, in line with HeRoP's mission. New 
                    data will be added regularly, and existing datasets will be updated as needed. Community groups can add request new data, which will be included 
                    if in line with our core mission. We additionally added a new resource page curating environmental mapping resources in Chicago.
